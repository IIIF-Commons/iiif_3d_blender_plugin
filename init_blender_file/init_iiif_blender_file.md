# Initial Blender file for viewing and editing IIIF Manifests

There are several Blender configuration options which may enhance the viewing of IIIIF manifests imported or created in Blender using the blender_iiif_3d_plugin add-on to Blender. A convenient way to configure your Blender installation this way is to start a Blender session with loading the init_iiif_blender.blend file. User may also edit their local copy of this file to change this initial setup according to their preferences.
