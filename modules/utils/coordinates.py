    """Helper class for converting between IIIF and Blender coordinates

    This implementation is intended to be compatible with the conversion
    that is by default carried out when a glTF model is imported with a call
    such as:
    bpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath=filepath)

    The conversion performed internally -- that is, in the coordinates of the
    points of the mesh as they are stored in Blender data, can be described by the
    relation between the XB, YB, ZB vectors that defined the Blender coordinate system
    and the XI, YI, ZI vectors which define the IIIF coordinate system in IIIF

    Those relations are:
    XI =  XB : # the X axis vector is the same in both coordinate systems
    YI =  ZB : # this is the vector which conventionally points UP in each system
    ZI = -YB : # this is the vectors which points "forward"  in the IIIF (and glTF)
               # usage of the term forward, for a humanoid model such as an astronaut
               # this is the conventoional front of the model, the direction in which
               # the astronaut is looking.
               # Blender however, uses a different semantics of the term forward, in
               # Blender "forward" means the direction in which a defaulte camera or
               # UI viewpoint is looking, in this Blender usage "forward" is +YB

    From these relations can derive the relations between xi,yi,zi coordinates in
    IIIF system with xb,yb,zb coordinates in

    in following, dot(A,B) denoted the conventional vector dot-product between
    two 3D vectors A,B

    For a vector P interpreted as location of a point in space with Coordinates
    (xi,yi,zi) in IIIF system and (xb,yb,zb) in Blender

    xi = dot(P,XI) = dot(P,XB) =   xb
    yi = dot(P,YI) = dot(P,ZB) =   zb
    zi = dot(P,ZI) = dot(P,-YB) = -yb

    or in reverse
    xb =  i
    yb = -zi
    zb =  yi

    During the import of a IIIF manifest a typical calculation will be to
    convert the (xi,yi,zi) coordinates of a PointSelectore resource into
    the (xb,yb,zb) coordinated of where to "locate" a mesh in Blender scene.

        The Blender Euler class allows several options for the order if axes rotation
        in defining the effect of rotations. In conversions of IIIF RotateTransform the
        natural Euler ordering for Blender will be "YZX" because of:

                -- the shift from intrinic axis rotation to extrinsic

        Returns a Blender Euler instance that applied to a Blender camera results

        This calculation differs from the calculation for model_transform_angles_to_blender_euler_angle
        because the initial state of a Blender camera is pointing downward, along
        the -Z Blender axis, while the initial state of an IIIF camera is points
